## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
**StreamEzy** is a decentralized video streaming platform, deployed using
the **Ethereum network**. To host a website a developers/clients have to pay
a huge amount of money for the server. We aim to **minimize the cost** by
using decentralized storage which is based on **IPFS protocol** for storing
and sharing the data in a distributed file system.
Content creators can stream flawlessly and at a **bare minimum cost** called
Gas Fees for using the network. Streamers can claim almost all of the
super chats made to them by their fans and supporters as we have made
provisions for payment in crypto currency. This **prevents any third party
interruption** like banks or government.
